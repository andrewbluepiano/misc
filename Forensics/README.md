## Lab5_MetaData_Script.sh

## exiftocsv.py
Reads in a plaintext file that contains the output of Phil Harvey's ExifTool file, and outputs a csv file containing the data.

## wayback_pull.py
A program for grabbing URL's of specific MIME types from the wayback archive. <br>
Requirements: Wayback https://pypi.org/project/wayback/ <br>
Note: This requirement will eventually be removed when the script is changed to pull things directly from the CDX API's. Didn't have time to write that up when making this.
